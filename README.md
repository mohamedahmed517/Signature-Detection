# Signature-Detection

## Objective
**Signature-Detection** is an AI-powered system designed to automatically verify and detect forged or authentic handwritten signatures.  
The system leverages deep learning and image processing techniques to identify subtle variations in writing style, pressure, and structure, ensuring accurate detection of signature authenticity.  

## Features
- Detects and classifies genuine vs. forged signatures.  
- Uses deep learning models for feature extraction and classification.  
- Supports preprocessing of signature images (noise removal, resizing, binarization).  
- Provides performance tracking and experiment logging.  
- Deploys with a user-friendly interface for real-time signature verification.  

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages:**  
  - Python  

- **Frameworks and Libraries:**  
  - TensorFlow / PyTorch  
  - OpenCV (for image preprocessing)  
  - Scikit-learn  
  - Hugging Face Transformers (for advanced feature extraction if needed)  

- **Experiment Tracking:**  
  - MLflow  

- **Deployment:**  
  - Streamlit / Flask for web interface  

- **Dataset:**  
  - Publicly available signature verification datasets (e.g., CEDAR, GPDS, or custom datasets).
